<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Tickled changed my life. No way around that. Before I cracked that book open, I was a mess. I was running myself into the ground, chasing some imaginary finish line. Four years into my streak with Chunk, I was burned out, juggling posts across five platforms, stressing over content, ignoring what mattered: family, friends, the here and now. I was locked into this grindset, thinking if I didn’t post a video, keep the streak alive, or get it all out there right now, I was failing. Time management? Awful. I was a hamster on a wheel, spinning nowhere fast.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Then </span><span class="s3"><b>Tickled</b></span><span class="s2"> hit me like a freight train. It was a mirror to my face, showing me exactly where I’d gone off the rails. It forced me to slow down, stop chasing, and start living. I realized I didn’t have to rush everything. Quality over quantity, purpose over pressure. I could hone my craft, make my best stuff, and release it when it was ready. That flipped a switch. Now, six years into my streak, I’m the best version of myself I’ve ever been. I don’t miss the important stuff anymore. I’m making smarter calls, letting things unfold naturally. I’m still balling till I fall, but I’m grounded in the moment, creating things that matter, not just checking boxes.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">It all started with a wild twist of fate, a random message to Duff McDonald. I was wrestling with a children’s book, hitting dead ends, feeling like a failure before I’d even begun. Then I land on the </span><span class="s3"><b>How to Tickle Yourself</b></span><span class="s2"> podcast, and Duff drops that he’s a writer. On a whim, I shoot him a note: “Hey man, I’ve been banging my head against this children’s book thing, hitting nothing but walls. Got any advice for a guy like me?” Nuts part? He says yeah, and turns out he’s already a huge Chunk fan. Blew my mind. Why would a New York Times bestselling author care about helping me? But he did. Looking back, he saw something in me I hadn’t clocked yet, some spark I’d been blind to.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Duff’s been a rock, throwing endless edits my way, keeping me on track, making sure I don’t overthink every comma. He helped me step into a new mindset: the best stuff flows when you let it, not when you force it. That’s Tickled in a nutshell—letting go and riding the infinite wave of choices. Through Duff, I met Tara Bach, now Chunk’s official illustrator. You’ve seen her art. Amazing, right? Wait till you see the children’s book. It’s gonna be fairytale-level magic. That connection was a gift, proof Tickled aligns things just when you need it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Tara’s a wizard. Her home’s like a Harry Potter set, tucked away on a quiet mountainside in upstate New York. Speaking of Harry Potter, that’s a bond Duff shares with his daughter, Marguerite. M, as he calls her, helps him flavor kombucha that’s out of this world good, and they’re both nuts about </span><span class="s3"><b>Welcome to Dog School</b></span><span class="s2">. What is Dog School, you ask? It’s in the book! It’s such a sweet lil story. That father-daughter magic seeps into everything Duff touches, including Tickled.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Then there’s Rockledge, a straight-up portal to another dimension. A pond down in a holler you transcend down what feels like an ancient Egyptian pyramid staircase, to what was once a pool, now brimming with these mystical fish that peacefully emerge with various colors glistening off the water as the mist lifts. That’d be my spot, lying by the still water, eyes closed, meditating. Up the hill, through a magical portal that opens up the mystical world, you reach a Harry Potter cabin! Seeing is believing on this one!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">OMG and that elderberry mint kombucha from Duff and Joey, brewed with a SCOBY, comes from all these amazing plants that Joey tends to in her E-glue style greenhouse equipped with a huge water tank. It’s something to see. It’s definitely on my bucket list to own one of those someday! And Duff hooked me up with the gear to start my own kombucha brewing process! Several bucks’ worth, just handed over like it was nothing. Blew me away. Goal’s to master it, pass it on, kick off a kombucha awareness chain. That’s Tickled—living organic, right here, right now.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">One moment sealed it. I’m at Rockledge, shooting the breeze with Duff about life, and he looks me dead in the eye: </span><span class="s3"><b>“You know you have to write this book, right?”</b></span><span class="s2"> Not a suggestion, not advice, a fact. He knew it. I knew it. I’d spent so long second-guessing: “Can I do this? Am I cut out for it?” But Duff saw past the doubt. He saw the story that had to be told, and he knew I was the guy to tell it. That flipped everything. I stopped thinking and started writing, pen to paper, fingers to keys. He was the Jedi master; I was the Padawan fumbling around.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">And Joey? Pure peace. Every time I’m at Rockledge, I feel it: warmth, calm, hospitality. You know those people who instantly make you feel at home? That’s Joey. </span><span class="s3"><b>lovemore</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s4"><i>“Welcome to life. Rules of life. Pay attention to possibility. Ride the wave of choice. If you start to fully focus on what is happening to you, things should start to get interesting right about now.”</i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s4"><i>“Love, The Universe.”</i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s4"><i>“P.S. It’s going to tickle.”</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">That’s how I roll now. Grab that book, read it once, twice, hit the audiobook. I wasn’t even a reader before this, but I’m dang glad I dove in. Every time I need a nudge, I press play. It keeps pushing me to be the best me I can be. Trust me on this one. Gardener Jeff’s got your back.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"><i>As Duff always says, Stay Tickled,</i></span><span class="s5"><i><br>
