WHY THIS MATTERS

This is not about branding. This is about real animals needing real help.

For seven years, Chunk The Groundhog and Gardener Jeff have been grinding every single day, sharing raw, unfiltered moments of wildlife coexistence from a backyard in Middletown Delaware. What started as a quirky groundhog stealing veggies has grown into a global movement, touching Millions of hearts across the world. Chunk’s story isn’t just cute. It’s a call to action. It’s proof that empathy, education, and respect for wildlife can change how we see the world.

Now we’re ready to take it to the next level. Chunk Land is building a fully functional wildlife rehabilitation center and sanctuary right here in Delaware, where Chunk took his first iconic bite. This isn’t just a dream. It’s a mission to rescue, heal, and release wild animals while providing a forever home for those who can’t return to the wild. Every dollar, every action, and every supporter fuels this vision of coexistence.

We’ve poured our hearts into this for seven years. The daily grind filming educating and advocating has built a community that believes in second chances for wildlife. But we can’t do the next step alone. Your sponsorship will transform Chunk’s legacy into a state of the art facility that saves lives and inspires generations. Together we’re not just building a sanctuary. We’re building a movement.

MUSIC AND TALENT ENGAGEMENT

ATTENTION MUSICIANS BANDS PERFORMERS TRADESPEOPLE AND CREATIVE PROFESSIONALS

Chunk Land was born from a backyard, a groundhog, and a man with a camera and a guitar. We’ve always believed in the power of music, storytelling, and community to move hearts and make change.

We are planning the first ever Chunk Land Music Festival — a multi-day live music and community event in Delaware with one purpose. To help fund and build the Chunk Land Wildlife Rehabilitation and Sanctuary.

This will not be a typical festival. This will be about heart, healing, and helping animals. Love Seed Mama Jump will anchor the lineup, but we’re looking to build a bill of passionate musicians and performers who believe in giving back.

If you’re a band or artist who wants to play
If you’re an audio engineer who wants to run sound
If you’re a lighting designer who wants to light up the field
If you’re a builder or vendor or volunteer with any trade skill
If you believe your gift could serve this mission

We want you on the Chunk Land Music Festival team.

This is a donation of time and spirit. We’ll promote you, highlight your band, and make sure the world sees your name tied to something that saves lives and inspires millions.

Reach out to join the festival team here:

This will be a space where animals are protected and artists are heard. Let’s make something beautiful together and help build the sanctuary we’ve all been waiting for.
